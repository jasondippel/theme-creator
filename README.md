# Theme Creator

This repo contains the beginnings of an app to create themes for use in other projects. Checkin later for more details...

## Setup

Setup is simple, just run:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Development

Running the entire application:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Only want to run the react piece? You can do so with the following commands:

```bash
$ yarn react-start # starts the react app on http://localhost:3000
$ yarn react-build # builds the react app and packages it in the build folder
```

### Linting

You can manually run the linting as such

```bash
yarn lint
```

A pre-commit hook also exists that will run this.
